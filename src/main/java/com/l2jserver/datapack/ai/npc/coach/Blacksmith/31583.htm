Oh, it's you! You want something from me! Hahahaha! Oh well, it's nice being famous, but the stress can get a bit much at times. I, the great Feynn, am... a... genius! Hahahaha. But I do not show the talent of the amazing Feynn to anyone so easily!<br>
It's a give-and-take - nothing is free in this world!<br>
