<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Romp:<br>
Even here near Aden Castle, if you let your guard down you can easily wind up dead. We are close to the border, after all. Of course, that only underscores the importance of a warehouse, don't you think? If you have valuable items, better to store them with us than carrying them around and risking them being stolen. Remember, any item you store with us is absolutely safe -- even if you die.<br>
