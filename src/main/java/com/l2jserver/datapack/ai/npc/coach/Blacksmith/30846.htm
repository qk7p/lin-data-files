Haha! Blacksmiths make armor, swords, polearms, axes, plows... But don't you start thinking we stop there! Over there, Aden Castle stands, proudly disregarding the laws of gravity. And you know why? Engineering! It would have collapsed a long time ago if it hadn't been for the efforts of the Black Anvil craftsmen.<br>
And... This is just a rumor, but... They say that the giant golem the rebels used to evict the human lords was made and sold by the Black Anvil. After all, if you take out the Black Anvil guild, who else could do something like that, right?<br>
