Tables in this folder are optional and extend the dataset of the original datapack tables. Unless you have enabled custom data loading, it is not a problem when this tables are missing from the database.

Example:
custom_spawnlist extends spawnlist with additional spawns. When the spawnlist table is updated by the L2J-Team you won't have to worry about duplicate IDs or data loss.
